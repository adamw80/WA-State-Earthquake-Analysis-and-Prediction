2. **Plot Historical Earthquake Data with Fault Lines:**
   - Visualize earthquake data on a map of Washington State alongside known fault lines.
   
3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Explore the frequency, magnitude distributions, and depth of earthquakes.
   
4. **Predict Future Earthquake Probabilities:**
   - Use machine learning models to predict the likelihood of future earthquakes based on historical data.
